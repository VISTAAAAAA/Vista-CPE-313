# 1. Objectives
# This activity aims to introduce students to the OpenCV's I/O functionality.

# 2. Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
# After this activity, the students should be able to:

# Read and write an image file
# Convert between image and raw bytes
# Access image data with numpy.array

# 3. Procedures and Outputs
# Most CV applications need to get images as input. Most also produce images as output. 
# An interactive CV application might require a camera as an input source and a window as an output destination. 
# However, other possible sources and destinations include image files, video files, and raw bytes.

# For example, raw bytes might be transmitted via a network connection, or they might be generated by an algorithm if we incorporate procedural graphics into our application. Let's look at each of these possibilities.
